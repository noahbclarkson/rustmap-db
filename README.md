# rustmap-db

Rustmap-DB is a high-performance, persistent, disk-backed map structure library in Rust. It offers thread-safe access to a key-value store with various utility functions, ensuring data integrity and efficient data management. The library is built on top of robust crates like DashMap, Serde, and Tokio, offering a blend of concurrency, serialization capabilities, and asynchronous runtime support.

## Features

- File-backed, thread-safe hashmap implementation.
- Asynchronous API for non-blocking operations.
- Serialization and deserialization of key-value pairs for persistent storage.
- Configurable hashmap for varying performance needs.
